# Translation tables for SurveyCTO

This repo contains translations for SurveyCTO web forms. Each table contains all the strings that can appear in the web forms UI, translated into a particular language. Each language needs its own table.

## Table structure

Each translation table is stored as a UTF-8 .csv file with 5 columns (and no headers). The columns are described below:

|Term|Translation|Context|Reference|Comment|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|This is the ID of the string. This is used to identify which string to use, so it cannot be changed.|This is the translated version of the string. I.e., this is how the string should appear when the current translation table is being used.|A note to help give more information about where/when this particular string shows up.|We use English as the reference language, so this column will contain the English translation of the term, just for reference.|Any other comments that might be helpful.|
